### Explanation:
The sliding window technique is used with two pointers, `s` (start) and `e` 
(end), both initialized to `0`.

- A dictionary `last_seen_indexes` stores the last seen index of each character.
- As we move through the string with pointer `e`, we check if the current 
  character (`curr`) was seen before:
  - If it was seen and its last seen index is inside the current window, we 
    update `s` to the next index after the last seen index of the current 
    character.
- After processing each character, we calculate the length of the current 
  substring and update the result if it's the longest found so far.
- The window is moved forward by incrementing `e`.

### Time Complexity:
- `O(n)`: Each character is processed at most twice â€” once when it's added 
  to the window and once when the start pointer (`s`) is moved past it. Thus, 
  the overall time complexity is linear, `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the 
  string.

### Space Complexity:
- `O(min(n, m))`: The space complexity is dictated by the dictionary 
  `last_seen_indexes`, which holds at most the number of unique characters. 
  Therefore, it is `O(min(n, m))`, where `n` is the string's length, and `m` is 
  the size of the character set (in this case, 26 for lowercase English 
  letters).
