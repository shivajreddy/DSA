### Explanation:

#### Initial Edge Case:
- If the input list `nums` is empty, return `0` since there are no sequences to 
  consider.

#### Hash Set for Efficient Lookups:
- The list is converted into a set (`num_set`) to allow `O(1)` average-time 
  lookups, which helps in checking the presence of consecutive numbers 
  efficiently.

#### Identifying the Start of a Sequence:
- The solution iterates through each number in the set. For each number, it 
  checks whether it is the beginning of a sequence by verifying that the 
  previous number (`num - 1`) is not in the set.
- If the number is the start of a sequence, it begins tracking the length of 
  this sequence.

#### Counting the Sequence:
- For each start of a sequence, the solution increments the number and checks 
  if the next consecutive number exists in the set.
- It keeps counting until the sequence breaks (i.e., there is no next 
  consecutive number).

#### Updating the Longest Streak:
- The solution keeps track of the maximum sequence length encountered 
  (`longest_streak`) and updates it whenever a longer sequence is found.

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
  - Every number in the list is processed at most twiceâ€”once when it is 
    identified as the start of a sequence and then for each consecutive number 
    in that sequence.
  - Hash set operations (like checking the existence of an element) take `O(1)` 
    on average.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`
  - The set stores all the numbers in the input list, which requires `O(n)` 
    space.
