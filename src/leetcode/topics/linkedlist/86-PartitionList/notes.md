Lessons Learnt:

Test Cases:
  - Didn't add any new test cases, other than the given. So not having a clue about edge cases.
  - Test-Cases should be:
    1. What if all are < x    IN: x=3, 1->1
    2. What if all are >= x   IN: x=3, 4->5
    3. What if there are no nodes to partition.   IN: x=3, 1->2->1->5->4  OUT: 1->2->1->5->4

Approach:
  - Failed in three cases, all due not having the above test cases.
  - Not sure where to start the 'prev' pointer at
  - The solution that i wrote and executed isn't simple and clear.(Good solutions are clear & simple)
