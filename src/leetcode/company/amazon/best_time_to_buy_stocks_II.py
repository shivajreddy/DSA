Constraints:
1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104
0 <= prices[i] <= 104

Scope & Assumptions:
- at most one share
- can buy & sell on same day
- no -ve numbers in input
- can buy & sell on same day
- can sell & buy on same day
- can buy today and only sell either today or another day in future, but not any previous day.

Observations:
- for maximize profit -> sum of all maximum trades
- max profit that can be made on a trade at given day
	- buy on that day
	- which is the highest profit day after this.
- Globally optimal solution: involves choosing sub solutions that might not be totally optimal
- For more efficient solution instead of a DP approach using 2 pointers with prefix-sum
  approach, where prefix-sum is re-initialized when ever a tradeâ€™s potential profit is
  lower that current profit for the trade.

Approach & Solution:

    ### Explanation
    The goal of this problem is to maximize profit by identifying potential buy and 
    sell days. The solution involves iterating over the list of prices, keeping track 
    of both the current profit and total profit as you move through the days.

    The approach taken here is a **greedy algorithm**:
    1. **Buy Pointer:** Track the day you bought the stock.
    2. **Sell Pointer:** Traverse through each day and calculate potential profit if 
    sold on that day.
    3. **Reset Conditions:** If the potential profit starts decreasing compared to 
    the previous profit, it means a local maximum has been reached (a good time 
    to sell). Add the current profit to the total and reset for the next transaction.
    4. **Final Adjustment:** After the loop finishes, any remaining profit from the 
    last ongoing transaction is added to the total profit.

    This ensures that we maximize the profit by summing up all local maximums without 
    revisiting any earlier buy-sell pair decisions.

    ### Time Complexity
    - **O(n)**: We iterate through the list of prices once, where `n` is the number 
    of days.

    ### Space Complexity
    - **O(1)**: The solution uses constant extra space, only storing variables like 
    `buy`, `curr_profit`, and `total_profit`.
