#### **FIRST STEP:** Problem Solving
1. **Understand the Problem (No Coding!):**
    - Verify you understand the provided test cases.
    - Make sure to comprehend the problem requirements and constraints.
    - Propose at least 3 additional test cases you are going to go through and WHY you are selecting them
2. **Design a Detailed Solution (No Coding!):**
    - Devise and plan your approach by experimenting with examples.
    - Verify the correctness and efficiency of your solution.
    - Takes notes in LC by [[How to Take Notes while Leetcoding]] and brainstorm ideas and example input/outputs to solve the problem.
    - [[Simple Solutions Are The Best Solutions]] and [[How to Get "Unstuck"]]
    - Summarize your solution in words or bullet points
3. **Verify Your Solution (No Coding!):**
	- [[How to Test and Verify Solutions]]
    - Walk through your solution on each input to ensure its correctness by explicitly describing all intermediate steps (variables, loops, etc)
    - If your approach fails any test cases, return to step 2 and make necessary modifications or find a new approach.
4. **Implement and Test:**
    - Keep the code short and simple.
    - Double-check for syntax errors.
    - Test your code using example inputs and additional test cases.
    - Debug and fix any issues that arise.

#### **SECOND STEP:** Studying and Deep Dive
1. **Identify Key Techniques**:
    - Reflect on the coding techniques that might apply to the problem. Think about the problems you've encountered before and how similar strategies can be applied.
2. **Reflect, Self Evaluate, and Study Other Solutions:**
    - Study solutions until you have a deep understanding of them. This study should be done off-camera. Understand how they arrived at the answer.
    - Implement the provided solutions using your own code, following the workflow from step (1) of the problem solving workflow.
    - Describe the solution in words and ensure it works on the intended inputs.
    - Implement the code and pass the test cases.
    - Self-evaluate your performance taking note of what went well and what to improve on.
3. **Record Your Deep Dive**:
    - Start your recording by explaining the problem and outlining your solution, including the runtime and space complexity.
    - **Re-solve From Scratch.** After studying the problem, you should be able to present the deep dive without using external resources. Clear your code editor and close all tabs of the solutions. It should be 100% independent.
    - Walk through several examples, explaining your thought process and justifying your approach.
	    - **We will be looking for every part of the workflow above here, making sure that you have deeply understood every part of the problem and its concepts.**
    - Code your solution, then walk through another example using your code to demonstrate its correctness. **Do not blindly copy your original solution. Once you record the deep dive, you should understand the solution well enough to code it without any issues.**
4. **Discuss Comparable Solutions**:
    - If applicable, briefly discuss other solutions, especially if they offer comparable runtime but differ in their approach or complexity.
5. **Link to Similar Problems**:
    - Describe other LeetCode problems that use similar techniques. This helps not only in reinforcing the concept but also in recognizing patterns in different problems.
6. **Review your Deep Dive Before Submitting.** Watch your deep dive and evaluate if you think it truly is a perfect solution. If not, then please start over, study the problem, and try again until you get it correct. The Deep Dive is more like a project presentation rather than a timed demonstration of your skills. We're giving you unlimited time and unlimited attempts; we're going to have high-expectations for the quality of your deep dive. We will ask you to redo it if we don't think it's a near perfect solution.
7. **Submit your Deep Dive** 

### Deep Dive Checklist
Here's the checklist of what you should accomplish in your deep dives.
1. Quickly summarize the problem statement.
2. Concisely describe your approach and how it works on enough examples for anyone who knows the problem can confirm your approach works.
3. State the correct runtime/space complexity.
4. Code it flawlessly (no debugging and good coding style)

### Lessons and Purposes of Deep Dives
1. **Passing The Test Cases Doesn't Mean Much.** Even if you pass the test cases on Leetcode, it doesn't mean you would've passed that problem in an interview. There's often much more to learn from a given problem. Deep dives should always be a perfect interview performance in effective communication and code execution.
2. **Pursuing High-Quality Interview Performance.** Writing barely passing solutions will not help you achieve high-quality interview performance. Deep dives pursue high-quality solutions by striving for near-perfect solutions in your practice. This is how you can become a strong interviewer.
3. **How and Why Instead of Just What.** Demonstrate that you understand not just **what** the optional solution is but also **how and why** it works. We will catch it if you're memorizing the solution and then explaining it without deeply understanding it.
4. **Building Perfect Interview Muscle Memory**. Efficiently explaining and flawlessly writing solutions within 15 minutes will reinforce the muscle memory of acing an interview question, both from coding and explanations. You'll build habits and feel what a passing interview feels like through experience; this will keep you on the right track, but more importantly off the wrong track in your interviews.
