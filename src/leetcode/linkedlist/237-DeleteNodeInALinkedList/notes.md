# 237. Delete Node in a Linked List  
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/description/)


- got it wrong and looked at solution
  - my answer kept adding 'None' as the last node, that is because
  i changed value of the last (n th) node to be None,
  but what i should do is set n-1th node's next value to be none.
- i did understand the problem well, but my implementation had error.
