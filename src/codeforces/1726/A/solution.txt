Observations:
- min is at 0, leave.
- max is at n-1, leave.
- segment must definetely include idx:0, or idx:n-1 or both
- when a number is rotated to idx:0, it's previous number will go to idx:n-1
  similarly, when number is rotated to idx:n-1, its next number will go to idx:0

possiblities:
- min or max or both are at 0,n-1 : return max-min
- consider full segement:
  - check when min is put in place
  - check when max is put in place
- consider only bringing min to place:
- consider only bringing max to place:
