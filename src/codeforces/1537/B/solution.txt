OBSERVATION:
- find the shortest path for every cell.
  -that is the shortest path from that cell to (i,j)
- so each location has the value of d*2, where d is the no. of edges 
  from that cell to (i,j), *2 for going back
  - value of cell(i,j) is 0
- return the sum of 2 largest values
- THE ABOVE LOGIC FAILS BECAUSE, SAY IN ABOVE GRID IF PLACE IN 
  (4,4) AND (4,3) THEN (4,3) IS ALREADY COVERED IN (4,4)
