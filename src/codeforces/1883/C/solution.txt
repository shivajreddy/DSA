k = 2 or 3 or 4 or 5


OBSERVATION:
- a is divisible by 2, and b is divisible 2, then a*b is divisible by 2
- we are only allowed to increase
  - focus on largest number in the array

- if any one of the number in array is divisible by k, then every number 
is, because we want (a1 * a2 * a3 ... * an) to be divisible by k
- if remainder is not 0, then (k-remainder) gives the number of times the current number should be increased to make it divisible by k

- possible answers: 0,1,2,3,4 that is 0..k-1
