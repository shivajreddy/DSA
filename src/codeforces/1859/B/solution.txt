OBSERVATIOIN: since we must pick min num from each array.
- the smallest number of all arrays will always be counted
- since we can only remove 1 num from the each array, the best way to 
  maximize result is to get rid of the smallest number
  - so to maximize results of each array, pick the smallest number in every
    array, and put all those in another array.


- just imagine if all these individual arrays are sorted, we dont have solving
this is easier to visualize

arary 1 : O T O O O ...
arary 3 : O Ts O O O ...    <-Ts is the smallest of all the T's
arary 2 : O T O O O ...
arary 4 : S T O O O ...   <- say this arr holds the smallest number(S) of all
...
arary 2 : O T O O O ...

here O means we dont care, T means the Target number that would end up
bein in the front.
now we sum all these T's(call this total), because they will end up on the front,
and all the front numbers which are currently the smallest number in each array,
will go to the array that is having the smallest number of all(as our 
1st observtion this smallest number among all the arrays will always be counted).
Now all the beginning numbers will come to the array that is holding the 
smallest number, we dont care where these numbers would end up, because we know 
for a fact that only number that we care is the smallest, and this arrays smallest 
is the smallest across all arrays. So from this array, we remove the T, which 
is the second smallest that was counted towards our total.

total = sum(all T's)
res = total + S - Ts

you would put all the min-numbers into the array holding the 2nd smallest
