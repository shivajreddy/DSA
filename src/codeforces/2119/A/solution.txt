a b x y
1 4 1 2

XOR
a ^ 1 : when a is even => a+1
a ^ 1 : when a is odd  => a-1

- since the 1st operation is +1, there is no point in 
  doing XOR when a is even
- only way to reduce a is, a should be odd, then a^1


a b x y     res=6
1 5 2 1

a b x y     res=-1
2 1 1 2

a b x y     res=1
3 2 2 1
