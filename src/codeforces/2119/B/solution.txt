Observations:
- if p,q are same point, then sum of all abs distances
between each point should equal 0

p=[3,3] q=[3,3] stops=4,5,1

- imagine drawing a circle with the current stop distance,
 starting from p.
 - at each stage we are choosing a point on this circle,
   and drawing another from that point as center, with next
   distance as the radius, eventually the last circle if 
   can be drawn such that at, q is one of the point on its 
   circumfarance, then yes, or else no

 - but this is exponentiall, because there are infinite points 
   on the circle's circumfarance.

- when we have two circles, we can find the intersection points 
  -but, we have multiple steps
  a -> s1 -> s2 <-> sk <- b
