1 is neither odd nor even
- 1..n odd
- 2..n even

k ?

n=10, k=3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

1 3 5 7 9
2 4 6 8 10

- n is always either odd or even
if n is even then left-half and right-half have equal numbers

- if n is odd, then the left-half(odd number sequence) will have 
that extra number

- n is odd:
  left will have  n//2+1 numbers
  right will have n//2   numbers

- n is even:
  left will have  n//2 numbers
  right will have n//2 numbers

now find if k'th number in the sequnce is in left or right sequence

if k is in left half, then find the kth number in the sequence 1,3,5,7...

if k is in right half, convert k to as if it is counting from the start of
    right half, i.e., k = k -
