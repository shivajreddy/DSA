x=7
1 2 3 4 5
5 4 3 2 1
1 3 5 7 9

u=0
u|1 = 

RULES:
- we always go from left to right in a book stack, so stop when hit 0 case
- can start with any of the three stacks
- all possible paths orderes: 123,132, 213, 231, 312, 321

OBSERVATION:
- bitwise OR properties:
    odd  | odd   = odd
    odd  | even  = odd
    even | even  = even
    even | odd   = odd
     0   | num   = num
    num1 | num2  = num2 | num1
- so if x is even.
