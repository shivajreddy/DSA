? ? ?
1 1 1
    1   mx
    1   mn
    0   mex

OBSERVATION:
- for three ???, then pick any same number for all 3 positions.
    since max-min == frist num that is not any of the three
    - so all 3 numbers must be the same number



5 5 1 ? ? 1
    5 5 1 1       mx
    1 ? ? ?      mn
    0  


when there is 0,
 mn = 0
 mx = 
 mex = 1,2,3... but can never be 0

OBSERVATION:
       so if you pick any max number the difference will be max itself
       and mex will always be mx+1, so it is not possible to pick any number
       - so if there is 0 in input it is always impossible

OBSERVATION:
    - if all nums in the input are same, then it is possible (not 0's though)
    - infact all nums must be same
