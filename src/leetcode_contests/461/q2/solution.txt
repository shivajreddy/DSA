Observation:
    - min size of sequence is 2
    last < max
    - greedy: stop when seq is valid, to get max no. of valid sequences
             - not valid => means last is the max, 
             so set this as the start of next possible seq.

    4   4


    1 < 2 < 3 < 4 = 4

    ? > ? > ? > ?
    - find all sequences that are decreasing
     - since we want maximize the sequences, when ever we find '>', we 
     use that as a sequence, then move on to finding the next valid sequences.

    any seq of same numbers of increasing nums are invalid
