'''
Bit -> is the smallest unit of data that a computer can process.
The state of bit is represented by a single binary value -> 0 or 1
Bits are stored in memory through the use of 'capacitors' that hold electrical charges
The charge determines the state of each bit,which, in turn determines the bit's value of 0 or 1.

Byte is a single unit, housing 8 bits

When we write numbers, we write them using base 10, also known as decimal.
While we take if for granted, when we write out a number such as 352 what we actually do is

352 = 3 * (10)^2 + 5 * (10)^1 + 2 * (10^0)

Binary to integer
100101 = 1 * (2^5) + 0 * (2^4) + 0 * (2^3) + 1 * (2^2) + 0 * (2^1) + 1 * (2^0)
100101 = 2^5 + 2^2 + 2^0 = 32 + 4 + 1 = 37
1001 = 2^3 + 2^0 = 9
